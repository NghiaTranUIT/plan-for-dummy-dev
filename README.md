# plan-for-dummy-dev
A plan for dummy developer who would like to take a serious aboard job ✈️

# How serious(ly) ?

At this time I'm writing this line. I'm so seriously to learn Data Structure + Algorithm from the scratch again.  
  
The main reason why I'm doing a (shit) things, because I would like to apply a aboard job after I've finished everythings (which I've started) at feels.  
  
Actually, as a iOS developer, in the whole working time, rarely I touch to Heap, Tree, Balance-Tree or Matric or advantage data structure or even some basic algorithm like heap sort, merging sort or somethings looks similars.
  
Sometime I use Queue, Stack, Priority Queue or basic sort are enough.
  
And stop at there.
  
And I know you're too (expept if you're a expert back-end or real data-science) 
  
Don't worry about it. I know it. **WE'RE DUMMY TOO**.  
  
The secondary reason is I don't want to stay and work at VN anymore. Not because they people or quality of company or environment or gorvement. I know there are lot of awesome company/startup around here. Such as Gotit, NotABasement, Misfit, East Agile, ...
  
  
All of them are really cool, and it was a my dream.

I don't want to be a "normal" people.

1. Pass entrance examination university after high school
2. Get a bachelors degree at 22 year old
3. Take a normal job
4. Make it confortable and enough salary
4. Get marriage at 25
5. Have a children at 27
  
and call it's successful (as their parent wants)

^ ^ ^  

Unfortunately, I don't like this ^

Sorry.

Actually, I can follow their path. Just stay at feels to the end. Make around 2-3000 USD monthly for high-class living cost.
Find some girl, and to next step.

If I close my eyes and do it, I will be the same people I know.  
  
IT's so **boring** at all.
  
I want to step out **COMFORTABLE ZONE** (at feels - for 3 years)
  
Try to live in **DANGEROUS ZONE**.
  
When my friends shared me about their journey at oversea countries, how they struggle to pass tough interview. How they see, and how they experiement when they work with foreign people around the world. 
  
I feels I have more motivation to do it.
  
They can do it, so I can to it do

# What's this repo ?

This repos is a best place to list the road map to achieve my goal.
  
And I maybe a good referencer for anyone who want to take steps like me.
